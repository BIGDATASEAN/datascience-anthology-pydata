# PyData, The Complete Works

The unofficial index of all [PyData](http://pydata.org/) talks.  This was intially going to be a pickled pandas DataFrame object, but then I decided against it. So here it is - in beautiful Github flavored markdown. 

There are placeholders for links to the video. Currently, the hyperlinks point to the pydata.org talk pages. Please do feel free to [make it better](#contribute) by contributing to the repo. 

#### What is PyData? 

> PyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
